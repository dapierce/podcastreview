# Podcast Review

Podcast reviewing website. The two folders contain seperate Node programs:

`/podcastreview-frontend` - Angular front end website

`/middleware` - Express server middleware communicates to a backend DB by APIs

## Installing both repos

```
cd podcastreview-frontend
npm install
```

The frontend will be installed by npm, and when it's over you can then install the middleware.

```
cd ../middleware
npm install
```

Now the middleware will be installed by npm, and with both complete, you are now ready to develop!
