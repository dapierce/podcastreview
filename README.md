# Podcast Review

Podcast reviewing website. The two folders contain seperate Node programs:

`/podcastreview-frontend` - Angular front end website

`/middleware` - Express server middleware communicates to a backend DB by APIs

## Installing both repos

```
cd podcastreview-frontend
npm install
cd ../middleware
npm install
```

The frontend will be installed by npm, and when it's over you can then install the middleware. Now the middleware will be installed by npm, and with both complete, you are now ready to develop!
